# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple fully connected feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy using no ML libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch. 
Currently trained and evaluated on a binary classification dataset from Kaggle (Breast-cancer). It's been one-hot encoded. 

Future plans:
c++ version
build a web application that showcases how neural networks works, important factors such as feedforwards, backpropagate etc..(in progress)
